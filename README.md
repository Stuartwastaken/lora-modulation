Signal generated the noise by changing the string, right now only SF of 12 seems to make a good signal. Once we capture that we will use the base signal modulation to make a demodulation file. 

You can edit the message variable to change the message.


Modulation.m is from the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHWepP1ZWTk&ab_channel=VisualElectric

which gives an idea of signals in LoRa

Signal.m is our working file for sending a string with LoRa
